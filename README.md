# üçÉLeaflet Map Templates
This repository template for Leaflet web maps will help you start a new leaflet map project quickly.


## üèÜ Goals
- The purpose of this repository is so that the initial setup for a Leaflet map is quick and easy. (My goal was to be able to quickly set up new Leaflet web map projects with the setup I had used in previous projects.)
- Explore various Leaflet map options and variations in different branches.
- This is great for any beginners that want to explore the use of JavaScript Leaflet library.

### Version 1
This branch includes some of my favorite plugins. The Leaflet-Geoman drawing toolbar is a powerful leaflet plugin for drawing and editing geometry layers.
